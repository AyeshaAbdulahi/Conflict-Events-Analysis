# Conflict-Events-Analysis
This project analyzes global political violence and protest events using the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED). I built an interactive data exploration workflow to examine how conflict patterns vary over time, across regions, and by event type.

## Key Features

Trend Analysis: Visualized global event counts from 1996â€“2024, highlighting the rise of civil unrest and violent events over time.

Geospatial Mapping: Created maps showing event density and distribution by country and region.

Event Type Breakdown: Compared civil unrest, violent events, and non-violent events, alongside associated fatalities.

Regional Insights: Examined hotspots such as Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and the Middle East for conflict trends.


## Tools & Skills

Tableau: Dashboard creation, interactive filters, geospatial visualization.

Excel / Data Cleaning: Preprocessing and structuring the dataset for visualization.

Analytical Skills: Extracting insights on conflict escalation, fatalities, and regional differences.


## Outcomes

Produced a set of interactive dashboards to explore 350k+ global conflict and protest events.

Identified that civil unrest is the dominant event type globally, with spikes in specific regions after 2010.

Highlighted the correlation between event type and fatalities, supporting research on political violence.
